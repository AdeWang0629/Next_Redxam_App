            My name is Samantha Anne & I am CoFounder of WGMG. Iâ€™ve lived in
            Austin for over 23 years and have roots in New England. WGMG was
            created between two likeminded individuals with different
            educational backgrounds and purpose of community. I am a self taught
            artist with inherent artistic knowledge passed down from
            generations. I dabble in several mediums & have an infinite desire
            to learn more. I am best known for my acrylic, resin work, technical
            skills and leadership. I believe in the power of positivity and
            cherishing those that see in color. Art is my aesthetic.
