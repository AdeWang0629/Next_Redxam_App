        Currently, there is not enough Total Cash in the pool to process
        withdrawals or claim interest. Cash available to withdraw increases as
        new deposits and loan repayments are made. Please check the poolâ€™s loan
        details for loan maturity dates. You can request the withdrawal process
        as before and return in 10 days time. Click here for more information.
